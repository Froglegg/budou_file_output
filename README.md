# budou_file_output
Python script I wrote for writing Budou Japanese output to file

Requires python and Budou. 

See https://github.com/google/budou for more information.

Out of the box, Budou CLI only prints to terminal. This script prints to an output file. 

NOTE: My project uses Tinysegmenter, but you can specify a different segmenter. See https://github.com/google/budou for details...
